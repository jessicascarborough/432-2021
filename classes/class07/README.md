The [Credit Where Credit is Due article on Mary Eleanor Spear is here](https://medium.com/nightingale/credit-where-credit-is-due-mary-eleanor-spear-6a7a1951b8e6), and check out [her Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Eleanor_Spear) as well, if you like.

## Materials for Today's Class

- Today's Slides are [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class07/432_2021_slides07.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/classes/class07/432_2021_slides07.Rmd).
- All 432 classes are video-recorded, and the recordings will be archived in the Zoom section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 07](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/minutepapers). Please complete it by noon Wednesday 2021-02-24.
2. The [Project 1 Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/01_project1_proposal.md) is due at 9 PM Monday 2021-03-01. If you don't have a data set ingested into R yet, I'd get on that today.
    - A tip: when developing an outcome for a *logistic* regression model, frame it as a "1 = yes/0 = no" numeric variable in R for modeling purposes, even if it originally comes as a Yes/No or other type of character variable. We will want to see that you have such a variable in place in your proposal, and it's perfectly OK if you also want to have it in your data as a named factor as well (perhaps for plotting purposes?)
3. The [Answer Sketch for Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/labs/lab02) is now available.
    - If you are looking for interesting approaches to visualizing data, perhaps in light of the Lab, I encourage you to take a look at Claus O. Wilke's [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) for lots of interesting ideas.
    - I also strongly recommend Winston Chang's [R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd edition](https://r-graphics.org/) for specific and very useful advice including step-by-step instructions for creating all sorts of plots using R.
4. I have changed the Course Calendar to move the deadline for [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/labs/lab03) back one week to Monday 2021-03-15 at 9 PM.
5. I'll also remind you that we don't have class next Tuesday 2021-03-02.
6. We will be learning a bit about the [tidymodels ecosystem](https://www.tidymodels.org/) (of which broom, rsample and yardstick are parts) starting around Class 10. The [tidymodels book](https://www.tmwr.org/) by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge will be a helpful follow-up resource for what we'll be doing. I'll remind you that Max Kuhn, one of the authors of that book, will be presenting at [a Cleveland R Meetup session on TidyModels from 6 to 7:30 PM tomorrow (2021-02-24)](https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-UseR-Group/events/273725112/). If you're interested, [go here to register (for free) and attend](https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-UseR-Group/events/273725112/). The talk will also be recorded and archived on the [Cleveland R Users Group YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7C4YZ-9itQW7Nl4RVKDflg).

## Sources for Today's Class

We'll be discussing the tools for regression fitting and evaluation in the `rms` package (developed by Frank Harrell and colleagues) quite a bit over the next couple of weeks. 

- You may be interested in [An introduction to the Harrell verse](https://www.nicholas-ollberding.com/post/an-introduction-to-the-harrell-verse-predictive-modeling-using-the-hmisc-and-rms-packages/) by Nicholas Ollberding. 
- Quoting that work: "(The) `Hmisc` and `rms` packages link users to a much broader set of materials on modern statistical methods and computing including predictive modeling, estimation, hypothesis testing, and study design."

Two key book-length references from Frank are:

- Frank E. Harrell and Chris Slaughter [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research Notes](http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf) (pdf).
- Frank E. Harrell [Regression Modeling Strategies](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/references/pdf/Harrell_Regression_Modeling_Strategies_2015_2e_protected.pdf), 2nd Edition, 2015.

We won't get to these other references much today, but they'll come up going forward...

- [Spending our data](https://www.tmwr.org/splitting.html), which is a chapter in Max Kuhn and Julia Silge [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/).

Steyerberg (2015) [The number of subjects per variable required in linear regression analyses](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/references/pdf/Austin_and_Steyerberg_2015_subjects_per_variable_in_linear_regression_jce.pdf) *J Clinical Epidemiology* 68: 627-636.

## One Last Thing

I'll link to a note and visualization by Jia You in *Science* from 2017-04-27 entitled "[Here's the visual proof of why vaccines do more good than harm](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/here-s-visual-proof-why-vaccines-do-more-good-harm)" in case you might be interested, as Ohio begins to announce its priorities for subsequent COVID-19 vaccination administration after the current group of people ages 65 and older.
