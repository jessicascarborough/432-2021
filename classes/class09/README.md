4. You might be interested in this [Data Science Career Q&A session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd3fvAILfMk), which is designed to help people (mostly undergraduates, but there is useful advice here at all levels) learn about transitioning from being a student to being someone with a job to do data science. It's part of the [Pod of Ascelepius](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkEz2tDR5K6AjlKw-JrV57w) I've mentioned in the past.
5. On 2021-03-24, Alison Hill will be speaking on [Making R Markdown work better for you](https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-UseR-Group/events/274520287) for the Cleveland R Users Group.
6. Carl Bergstrom at the University of Washington recently developed a 50 minute lecture (now on YouTube) entitled [Avoiding the Pitfalls of Selection Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSVg_DqPkNM) which may of some interest to you.

[The Climate Crisis: Addressing Impacts on Clinical Practice in the Great Lakes Region](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-climate-crisis-addressing-impacts-on-clinical-practice-great-lakes-tickets-138287576865) is a half-day symposium on 2021-03-10 (8 AM to noon) targeting health care professionals, clinicians of all types, students and trainees. From the registration page, "this unique conference will educate and inspire health professionals and students about the health impacts of climate change. The symposium will not only educate participants but inspire motivation and provide the tools to develop solutions to counteract the health effects of climate change."
8. [RStudio has an internship available this summer](https://rstudio.com/about/job-posting/?gh_jid=4387673003). Not everyone is a good fit, but maybe you are?
9. The Translational Data Analytics Institute hosts a free summer camp every year with the goal of inspiring more young women to enter the field of data science and analytics.  The 2021 camp will be 100% virtual, running July 13-16 from 9 am – 12:30 pm.  **Young women who will be entering grades 8, 9, or 10 in autumn 2021** and attend schools within the State of Ohio are encouraged to apply.  Any student in those grades attending school in Ohio is welcome to apply.  Applications are due April 30.
