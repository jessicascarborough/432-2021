# R-Basics

This section has some information to remind you of some things when using R. I hope it will be of some use to students in both 432 and 500. It was written prior to the pandemic, but the ideas still hold up.

- The [r-basics.pdf](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/r-basics/r-basics.pdf) PDF file and the [r-basics.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/r-basics/r-basics.Rmd) R Markdown file remind/show you how to do a number of things you'll need, especially in the early homework assignments. I used the R Markdown file to create the PDF.
- This includes some data management, some fundamental statistical inference ideas, and (especially) some logistic regression.

Sections of the document include

3. Getting Data into R from Excel
4. Describing a Pilot Study
5. A Logistic Regression Example
6. Logistic Regression with Multiple Predictors
7. A Data Management Primer (includes recoding and simple imputation materials)
12. Some tips for using RStudio and R Markdown

There's a lot of stuff here, and I don't expect you to devour it, but I do hope it serves as a useful guide for remembering / learning how to do some of the "basics" that will be relevant in our course.
