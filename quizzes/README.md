# Quiz Main Page for 432 in Spring 2021

You will complete two Quizzes in 432 this semester. 

During the semester, you will have two quizzes to complete. Each quiz is taken online via a Google Form (like the Minute Papers or the “Welcome to 432” survey.) Each quiz includes both short-answer and multiple-choice items. The quizzes focus on whether you can apply the tools developed in class to address small problems.

You will receive access to the quiz more than a week before it is due, and each quiz will be designed to take about 6 hours to complete, so the time pressure should be minimal. If you need to make alternate arrangements for a Quiz, please contact Professor Love via email as soon as possible, at least a week before a Quiz is released.
