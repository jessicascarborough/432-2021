# References and Resources for 432 in Spring 2021

This is a repository of things I may use or refer to during the semester. If you're looking for additional things to read, this is the right place. 

Some items are **password-protected**, which if you click them will only let you download them from Github, and then open with a password on your own machine. The password is revealed in the first class session.

All of these items will be linked through [Class READMEs](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/classes), as well, as they become useful to us.

## Course Notes

- The 431 notes and other materials will remain at https://thomaselove.github.io/431/ until June 2021.
- The 432 main page is at https://thomaselove.github.io/432/ and will remain there until June 2021.

## The Books We've Read in 431 or Will Read in 432 include:

- (431) David Spiegelhalter *The Art of Statistics* available at Amazon and other retailers.
    - Here's [the book's website](https://dspiegel29.github.io/ArtofStatistics/) which contains R code, corrections and other materials.

## YouTube Video Series Recommended by Dr. Love

1. Frank Harrell's [Biostatistics for Biomedical Research (BBR) Course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA/videos) includes a series of lectures on many of the topics we'll be discussing in 432, in addition to several late-breaking items. Details on the course are available [here](https://hbiostat.org/bbr/) and the notes are linked in the Statistics and Modeling books below.
2. Richard McElreath [Statistical Rethinking (Winter 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI) lecture series is the best introduction to Bayesian ideas and methods available. 
    - If you want to just spend two hours rather than dive in to the full thing, Richard's lecture [Bayesian Inference is Just Counting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NEMHM1wDfI) is great, too.
    - Richard's book [Statistical Rethinking (2nd edition)](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) is available to you through [the CWRU library system](https://case.edu/library/) as an ebook. See also the freely available book by Kurz, below.
