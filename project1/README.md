# Project 1 for 432 in Spring 2021

This is the main page for Project 1. 

## Instructions

1. [Start here with General instructions for Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/00_project1_general.md). Project 1 includes two Tasks.
2. Next, visit the [Specific instructions for Task 1 (The Proposal)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/01_project1_proposal.md).
    - This includes details on the required data cleaning and exploratory work, and is what you'll be working on in February.
3. Next, review the [R Markdown templates for Project 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/templates/README.md) and select one to use for your work on Task 1 and (later) on Task 2.
    - Using one of these templates will yield results that are attractive, organized and easy for us to review. Please use them.
    - There is also a [(draft) rubric we'll use in evaluating your proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/project1_proposal_rubric.pdf), which should help you get through the Proposal stage efficiently.
4. Finally, look at the [Specific instructions for Task 2 (Analyses and Presentation)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/02_project1_analyses.md) so you'll know where you're heading.
    - This includes data analyses and presentation work, and is what you'll be working on in March.

All deadlines for projects are specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).

## Need some suggestions for attractive data for 432 projects?

- If you have any doubt at all about whether a data set would work or whether we'll find it to be acceptable, drop in to [TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/contact.html) and show it to us, or send us a note about it on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/spring2021/pqhs432).
    - Otherwise, you run the risk of us rejecting your proposal because we don't want you to use the data you've chosen.
    - If a TA is unsure about what you're suggesting, they'll put you in touch with Dr. Love for an "OK".

Four especially appealing sources that I'd really like to see people use for Project 1 are:

1. The [Health and Retirement Study](https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/public-survey-data?_ga=2.79574685.849210420.1612760982-241136149.1612760982)
2. The [General Social Survey](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/)
3. The many many public use data sets available at [ICSPR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/)
4. The [500 Cities and PLACES data portal](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/browse?category=500+Cities+%26+Places&sortBy=newest&utf8), most probably I would focus on the [County-level data](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-County-Data-20/swc5-untb).

Other sources students have used successfully in the past and that Iâ€™m happy to see include:

5. [National Center on Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/ftp_data.htm) including NHANES
6. [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm)
7. [County Health Rankings](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation)
8. [Kaggle Public Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) are allowed but **only** those with really useful variables, no hierarchical structure and strong descriptions of how the data were gathered (which is at best 5% of what's available on Kaggle). Don't select a Kaggle data set without running it by Dr. Love on Piazza (a private note is fine) to see if he's willing to let you use it.

- Data on COVID-19 is permitted for 432 projects, but most of the available data is longitudinal and thus unsuitable for Project 1. 
- Don't type "regression data sets" into Google. That will lead you to data sets we've seen before, and don't want to see again. The data sets posted by the Cleveland Clinic for educational purposes are also a poor choice, since we've seen them before, many times.
- I encourage those of you who used NHANES data last Fall in 431 to use something else (just so that you can get familiar with some new data), but those of you who really want to may benefit from some [advice from the 431 class about using NHANES data](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2020-projectB/your2.html) in a different project. Note that your rules are different, but most of the advice still holds well.

## Running a Data Set Past Us for Project 1

To get Dr. Love and the TAs to "sign off" on a data set as appropriate for your project 1 proposal, you need to tell us five things in a (private or public - your choice) note on Piazza in the project1 folder:

1. the data source, as described [here in item 1 in the proposal instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/01_project1_proposal.md#1-data-source) along with a URL so we can access the data
2. a description of who the subjects are and how they were selected, as described [here in item 2 in the proposal instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/01_project1_proposal.md#2-the-subjects) - it helps if you also tell us how many subjects are in the data
3. what quantitative outcome you plan to use in your linear regression model, including its units of measurement and the minimum, mean and maximum values available in your data
4. what binary outcome you plan to use in your logistic regression model, specifying both of the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive categories and how many subjects fall into each of those two categories.
5. that you've carefully read the [what makes an acceptable data set section of the project 1 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/00_project1_general.md#3-what-makes-an-acceptable-data-set) and can confirm that your data meets all of those specifications.

Also, we ask that you not ask us to pick between two "options" - submit the one you'd rather do. If it's a problem, we'll let you know, and you can then change to another option if necessary.
