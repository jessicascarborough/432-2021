# Data Source

Details, details.

# The Subjects

# Loading and Tidying the Data

## Loading the Raw Data

Ingest your raw data here.

## Cleaning the Data

All cleaning and tidying goes here, leading to a single tibble in R. Be sure to explain what you're doing and why you're doing it. Do not show listings of the data as you clean it. 

## Another Cleaning the Data subheading.

I expect you'll use several subheadings here to help delineate tasks.

# The Tidy Tibble

## Listing the Tibble

Here, you will list the tibble, after all cleaning is complete. Just list the tibble.

## Size and Identifiers

Do what we asked you to do in the instructions.

## Saving the R data set

Now, save your tibble as an R data set (.Rds file, which you'll also provide to us.)

# The Code Book

See the instructions and be sure that your code book includes all necessary elements.

## Defining the Variables

Here, to help you get started, is the example from the instructions.

Variable | Role | Type | Description
-------- | ---- | ---- | -----------------
`subjectID` | identifier | - | character code for subjects
`sysbp` | outcome | quant | Most Recent Systolic Blood Pressure, in mm Hg
`statin` | input | 2-cat | Has a current statin prescription? (Yes or No)


## Numerical Description

Here's where you would run `describe` from `Hmisc`.

# Linear Regression Plans

## My Quantitative Outcome

Follow the instructions.

## My Planned Predictors (Linear Model)

Follow the instructions.

# Logistic Regression Plans

## My Binary Outcome

Follow the instructions.

## My Planned Predictors (Logistic Model)

Follow the instructions.

# Affirmation 

Be sure to include the text provided in the instructions.

Note that in the proposal, you will skip from here to the References and then Session Information, skipping the next three sections (which only apply to the full portfolio, and should not be included in the proposal.)

In the full document (part of Task 2) we will add in sections called 

- Linear Regression Analysis
- Logistic Regression Analysis
- Discussion

after the Affirmation and before the References.

# References

If you are including references, here's the place for them. You should likely be providing a reference for your data set, at least.

# Session Information

```{r}
xfun::session_info()
```

# Notes from Dr. Love

1. Remember to review the [Submission Requirements for the Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/project1/01_project1_proposal.md#submission-requirements) carefully before you submit your work
2. Be sure to spellcheck the R Markdown document (just hit F5) and also proofread the HTML result that comes out of this work.
3. Remove these Notes and any other notes guiding you through this template before you knit the work into an HTML file.
