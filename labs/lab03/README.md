# Lab 03 

This is the main page for Lab 03 for the 432 course in Spring 2021.

Deadlines for all Labs are provided in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).

## Instructions

The instructions for completing Lab 03 [are now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md). 

- On 2021-03-05, Dr. Love simplified [the instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md) slightly for the fourth part of question 1, and also added [four hints we hope will be helpful for question 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md#four-hints-for-question-1). 
- Also on 2021-03-05, Dr. Love substantially changed Question 2 to make the process of completing each step clearer. Please use [the version dated 2021-03-05](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md) to prepare your responses for Lab 3.
