This is the main page for Lab 03 for the 432 course in Spring 2021.

Deadlines for all Labs are provided in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html).

## Instructions

The instructions for completing Lab 03 [are now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md). 

- On 2021-03-05, Dr. Love simplified the instructions slightly for the fourth part of question 1, and also added [four hints we hope will be helpful for question 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab03/lab03_instructions.md#four-hints-for-question-1).
