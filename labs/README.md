## Grading

See [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2021-syllabus/assignments-and-grading.html) for details on how grading works on Labs.

## Seeing Our Feedback on Your Work

On 2021-02-15, Dr. Love sent you an email with the subject line "432 Lab Code". 

- That Lab Code is a three-digit number that you'll want to make a good note of, because it will enable you to track the feedback we have for you on Labs. 
- A Google Sheet should now appear on our Shared Google Drive entitled **Lab Feedback for 432 Students**. 
- That document contains the grades on the lab (each individual question, plus the total) and the TAs' comments for you on your submission, identified by the Lab Code I've sent to you.

We do this for two reasons:

1. It's easier for Dr. Love and the TAs than other options.
2. Without identifying anyone, we want you to be able to see the challenges that other folks are facing in doing these Labs. 

I remind you that our Syllabus has [more details on how things are graded](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2021-syllabus/assignments-and-grading.html#minute-papers-and-class-participation), and in particular has [information on the Lab regrade policy](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2021-syllabus/course-policies.html#regrade-policy) (also listed below), and on [how your final grade will be determined](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2021-syllabus/assignments-and-grading.html#final-grade), and we ask you to please review those three links before you express (or feel) concern about your grades on any assignment in this class.

## Grading Errors and Regrade Requests

The Lab Regrade Request Form is now available at http://bit.ly/432-2021-lab-regrade-requests. This is how we handle all grading errors and regrade requests on Labs. 

- Essentially, if you want Dr. Love to review your grade on one (or more) of our first five Labs, fill out [the Regrade Request Form](http://bit.ly/432-2021-lab-regrade-requests) anytime before 2021-05-14 at Noon. 
- In mid-May, Dr. Love will then open [the form](http://bit.ly/432-2021-lab-regrade-requests). If you have requested additional points that could change your course grade, he'll review your request. If not, then he won't. 
- Visit [the Assignments and Grading section of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2021-syllabus/assignments-and-grading.html) for more details on this policy.

The [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/432/calendar.html) also provides a link to the Lab Regrade Request Form and its associated deadline (2021-05-14 at noon).
