432 Lab 02 for Spring 2021
================

Version: 2021-02-15 08:39:31

# General Instructions

Submit your work via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). The deadline is
specified on [the Course
Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432/calendar.html).

Your response should include an R Markdown file and an HTML document
that is the result of applying your R Markdown file to the
`oh_counties_2020.csv` data, available on [our Data and Code
page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data), as well as [in the data
subfolder](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/tree/master/labs/lab02/data)
for this Lab.

Start a separate R Project for Lab 02, as your first step, and place the
data in that project’s directory or (if you want to match what I did) in
a data sub-directory under that project’s directory.

-   There is an R Markdown **template** for Lab 02, which [you can find
    here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/432-2021/blob/master/labs/lab02/lab02_template.Rmd).
    Please feel encouraged to use the template as it is, or modify it to
    produce something that you like better. This template uses the
    `downcute` approach from the `rmdformats` package.
-   If you want to see how this template looks as a knitted HTML file,
    [visit this link](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/lab02-template-432-2021).

## The `oh_counties_2020.csv` data

The `oh_counties_2020.csv` data set I have provided describes a series
of variables, pulled from the data for the 88 counties of the the State
of Ohio from the [County Health
Rankings](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/rankings/data/oh) report
for 2020.

-   Several detailed County Health Rankings files augment these 2020
    Ohio Rankings Data. Find [those items
    here](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/ohio/2020/downloads)
    if you’re interested.

The available variables are listed below. Each variable describes data
at the **COUNTY** level.

**Note**: There is a Hint for Lab 02 having to do with ingesting these
data available on Piazza in the `lab02` folder.

## Question 1 (30 points)

Create a visualization (using R) based on some part of the
`oh_counties_2020.csv` data set, and share it (the visualization and the
R code you used to build it) with us.

The visualization should:

-   be of a professional quality,
-   describe information from at least three different variables listed
    above (you are welcome to transform or re-express the variables if
    that is of interest),
-   include proper labels and a meaningful title,
-   include a *caption* of no more than 75 words that highlights the key
    result.

In developing your caption, I find it helpful to think about what
question this visualization is meant to answer, and then provide a
caption which makes it clear what the question (and answer) is.

-   You are welcome to find useful tools for visualizing data in R that
    we have seen in either 431 or 432 or elsewhere. Don’t neglect ideas
    you’ve read about (in 431 in Spiegelhalter) or in Leek, for
    instance.
-   Although you may fit a model to help show patterns, your primary
    task is to show **the data** in a meaningful way, rather than to
    simply highlight the results of a model.

We will evaluate Question 1 based on the quality of the visualization,
its title and caption, in terms of being attractive, well-labeled and
useful for representing the County Health Rankings data for Ohio, and
how well it adheres to general principles for good visualizations we’ve
seen in 431 and 432.

## Question 2 (20 points)

Identify an important thing that you learned about prediction from your
reading of Nate Silver’s *The Signal and the Noise* either in Chapter 2
(about political predictions) or in chapters 3 (baseball), 4 (weather)
or 5 (earthquakes). What does this thing you learned suggest to you
about the way you build prediction models, and how can you adopt this
new way of thinking to improve the models you’ll generate in this Lab
and elsewhere in your scientific life?

Write a short essay (between 150 and 250 words is appropriate) using
clearly constructed and complete sentences to respond to this. The essay
should be composed using R Markdown.

-   We encourage you to provide brief citations or quotes from Silver
    and elsewhere as needed.
-   In citing *The Signal and the Noise* a quotation with (Silver,
    Chapter X) is sufficient.
-   In citing another work, a more detailed citation is appropriate.
    Citations and quotations do not count towards the suggested word
    limit.

## Question 3 (20 points)

Create a linear regression model to predict `obese_pct` as a function of
`food_env` adjusting for `median_income`, and treating all three
variables as quantitative. Specify and then carefully interpret the
estimated coefficient of `food_env` and a 90% uncertainty interval
around that estimate in context using nothing but complete English
sentences. A model using main effects only, entered as linear
predictors, will be sufficient.

## Question 4 (10 points)

Evaluate the quality of the model you fit in Question 3 in terms of
adherence to regression modeling assumptions, through the specification
and written evaluation of residual plots. What might be done to improve
the fit of the model you’ve developed in Question 3? Identify by name
any outlying counties and explain why they are flagged as outliers.

## Question 5 (20 points)

Create a logistic regression model to predict the presence of a water
violation (as contained in `h2oviol`) on the basis of `sev_housing` and
`pm2.5`. Specify and then carefully interpret the estimated odds ratio
associated with the `sev_housing` effect and a 90% uncertainty interval
around that estimate in context using nothing but complete English
sentences. Use a model with main effects only.

## Please add the session information.

Finally, at the end of this lab and all subsequent assignments
(including the projects), please add the session information. My
preferred way for you to do this for 432 is…

``` r
xfun::session_info()
```
